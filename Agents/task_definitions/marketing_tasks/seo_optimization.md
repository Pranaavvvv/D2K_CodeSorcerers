I am also providing a PDF file located at: `{pdf_path}` containing additional SEO research, meeting notes, or competitor analysis. Use the PDFSearchTool to extract information from this document and incorporate those insights into your analysis.

Your analysis MUST include:
- A comprehensive assessment of current SEO performance
- Identification of critical issues impacting search visibility
- Prioritized recommendations with implementation difficulty ratings (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Specific action items for each recommendation
- Expected impact of implementing each recommendation

Provide concrete examples and specific changes rather than generic advice. Your recommendations should be practical, actionable, and tailored to the specific website.

## Expected Output
A comprehensive SEO audit report with prioritized recommendations, specific action items, and expected impact assessments. The report should be organized by SEO area (technical, on-page, content, etc.) with clear implementation guidance.
